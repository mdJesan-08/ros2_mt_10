Here I build a control system initially using Ros2 and Arduino via Pyserial .You can find it in this folder named ros2_diff_drive_V1
After some days we decided to shift into Pixhawk .So I tried Pymavlink with Ros2 .For pymavlink I personally got a very good documentation from my Bracu Duburi Team 
Here is the Link https://www.ardusub.com/developers/pymavlink.html
