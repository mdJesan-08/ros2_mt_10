Here I build a control system initially using Ros2 and Arduino via Pyserial .You can find it in this folder named ros2_diff_drive_V1
After some days we decided to shift into Pixhawk .So I tried Pymavlink with Ros2 .For pymavlink I personally got a very good documentation from my Bracu Duburi Team .
The mavlink package is mt_rover_wheel 
Here is the Link https://www.ardusub.com/developers/pymavlink.html
I actually Used Cytron MDDS 60 to run our brushed motors .MDDS 60 has a lot of features .If you want to try this you can use normal brushed esc available in our country
